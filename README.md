This is a small utility class which allows Java programs to communicate with SmokeSignal Servers with the usual ServerCommand() funciton.

ServerCommand has some overloads like in ViBE, which include an override IP address. Unlike ViBE, however, it includes a debug mode which shows the ByteReader's reading process, as it is much more intricate than the one in VB.NET.
